        <p class="text-break"> I have been writing as Oni Neko Gamer for around three years, I began writing at the
            beginning of the global pandemic as a way to take my mind away from what was happening around the world and
            to sharpen my writing skills whilst
            writing about something that I love doing, playing video games! I began writing on Wordpress since it as an
            easy to use development tool for new and veteran coders a like, after examining the code on my work it
            sparked my interest in learning how
            to do it for myself! I am currently undertaking a Level 5 Diploma in Fullstack Web Development and with my
            new skills I am going to migrate all of my previous work to a new, jazzier more responsive site. I mostly
            focus on retro titles and import
            games mostly due to growing up in the U.K and watching enviously at games that did not see a release here!
            I also enjoy writing about Anime, Arcade sticks and modifying them as well as a host of other topics such
            as what I am playing currently and retrospectives on whole game series. Gaming is a passion for me and
            something that I don't think that I will
            ever grow tired off, it is an art form that is just as valid as Cinema and Animation so I hope that you
            follow me on my journey to spill my thoughts on the topic out into the internet.
