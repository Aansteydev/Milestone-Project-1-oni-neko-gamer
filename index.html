        <h1 class="h1"> Why I love writing </h1>
        <p class="text-break"> I have been writing as Oni Neko Gamer for around three years, I began writing at the
            beginning of the global pandemic as a way to take my mind away from what was happening around the world and
            to sharpen my writing skills whilst
            writing about something that I love doing, playing video games! I deided to start a blog on Wordpress since it as an
            easy to use development tool for new and veteran coders a like, after examining the code on my work it
            sparked my interest in learning how
            to do it for myself! I am currently undertaking a Level 5 Diploma in Fullstack Web Development and with my
            new skills I am going to migrate all of my previous work to a new, jazzier more responsive site. I mostly
            focus on retro titles and import
            games due to growing up in the U.K and watching enviously as games that did not see a release here slipped through our fingertips!
            I also enjoy writing about Anime, Arcade sticks and modifying them as well as a host of other topics such
            as what I am playing currently and retrospectives on whole game series. Gaming is a passion for me and
            something that I don't think that I will ever grow tired off. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-break">I like to think that I write about games that have been forgotten or just ignored by other gamers due
            to the issues of playing a game in a foreign language but this leads to why I do it! I love highlighting games that some 
            people may never have heard of even with the internet at the their fingertips. One of my favourite times of the year is 
            Halloween, so I tend to write about survival horror or just horror themed titles for the occasion with previous titles 
            being Getsuu Fuma Den, Baroque and Kid Dracula which are all different styles of horror themed games but just as appropriate
            for the spookiest time of the year! There are also other year round events such as a 30 days of music article where I delve 
            deep into some of my favourite game soundtracks and I also like to share my newest gaming pickups with readers....don't worry,
            there are no long unboxing videos, just my initial thoughts on what I have purchased and how likely I am to give it a review in 
            the near future! speaking of reviews, they are reviewed without a score but they feature a handy dandy pro's vs con's list at the bottom
            I have always found that scoring based review systems are a bit redundant and with great writing you should be able to describe how good
            something is without relying no numbers to do the work for you!  
        </p>
        <p class="text-break"> I think that if you are into gaming, especially the niche side of the hobby then there will be a ton of things
            for even the most veteran of gamers to sink their teeth into. I always enjoy reading comments from the fantastic but small fan
            base that I have built up over the past few years, as the readers are just as passionate about the topic as I am! It is slowly turning
            into a small online community of gamers and I would love more people to join in on the fun! there is also a new section that is ran once 
            a fortnight for reader article submission, whilst it is growing in size it would be brilliant to hear more peoples thoughts on gaming 
            and their experiences! so if this sounds like you, then don't be shy and submit a piece of work about your favourite game even if your 
            writing skills aren't brilliant or your grasp of the English language is lacking I will work with you to edit your work so that you
            can share it with the community, because that is what we are all about at Oni Neko Gamer.
