            <h1 class="h1"> Why I love writing </h1>
            <p class="text-break"> I have been writing as Oni Neko Gamer for around three years, I began writing at the
                beginning of the global pandemic as a way to take my mind away from what was happening around the world
                and
                to sharpen my writing skills whilst
                writing about something that I love doing, playing video games! I decided to start a blog on Wordpress
                since
                it was an
                easy to use development tool for new and veteran coders a like, after examining the code on my work it
                sparked my interest in learning how
                to do it for myself! I am currently undertaking a Level 5 Diploma in Fullstack Web Development and with
                my
                new skills I am going to migrate all of my previous work to a new, jazzier more responsive site. I
                mostly
                focus on retro titles and import
                games due to growing up in the U.K and watching enviously as games that did not see a release here
                slipped
                through our fingertips!
                I also enjoy writing about Anime, Arcade sticks and modifying them as well as a host of other topics
                such
                as what I am playing currently and retrospectives on whole game series. Gaming is a passion for me and
                something that I don't think that I will ever grow tired off.
            </p>
            <p class="text-break">I like to think that I write about games that have been forgotten or just ignored by
                other
                gamers due
                to the issues of playing a game in a foreign language but this leads to why I do it! I love highlighting
                games that some
                people may never have heard of even with the internet at the their fingertips. One of my favourite times
                of
                the year is
                Halloween, as I tend to write about survival horror or just horror themed titles for the occasion with
                previous titles
                being Getsuu Fuma Den, Baroque and Kid Dracula which are all different styles of horror themed games but
                just as appropriate
                for the spookiest time of the year! There are also other year round events such as a 30 days of music
                article where I delve
                deep into some of my favourite game soundtracks and I also like to share my newest gaming pickups with
                readers....don't worry,
                there are no long unboxing videos, just my initial thoughts on what I have purchased and how likely I am
                to
                give it a review in
                the near future! speaking of reviews, they are reviewed without a score but they feature a handy dandy
                pro's
                vs con's list at the bottom
                I have always found that scoring based review systems are a bit redundant and with great writing you
                should
                be able to describe how good
                something is without relying on numbers to do the work for you!
            </p>
            <p class="text-break"> I think that if you are into gaming, especially the niche side of the hobby then
                there
                will be a ton of things
                for even the most hardcore of gamers to sink their teeth into. I always enjoy reading comments from the
                fantastic but small fan
                base that I have built up over the past few years, as the readers are just as passionate about the topic
                as
                I am! It is slowly turning
                into a small online community of gamers and I would love more people to join in on the fun! there is
                also a
                new section that is ran once
                a fortnight for reader article submission, whilst it is growing in size it would be brilliant to hear
                more
                peoples thoughts on gaming
                and their experiences! so if this sounds like you, then don't be shy and submit a piece of work about
                your
                favourite game even if your
                writing skills aren't brilliant or your grasp of the English language is lacking I will work with you to
                edit your work so that you
                can share it with the community, because that is what we are all about at Oni Neko Gamer.
