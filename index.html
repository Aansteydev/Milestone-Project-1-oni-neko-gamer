                        <p>I have been writing as Oni Neko Gamer for around three years,
                            it started <br>during the global pandemic as a way to take
                            my mind off of things and<br> to write about something
                            that I have been passionate<br>about since I was a child, Video Games!
                            I have been playing<br> Video Games for as long as I can remember, <br>which is a normal
                            story for people of my vintage!</p>
                        <p>I write about import retro games more than western titles,<br> what interests me the most
                            about them is that they weren't released locally<br>
                            so it feels a bit like you're playing a game that no one else has seen!<br>My journey into
                            import titles has lead me to begin to learn Japanese<br>
                            I am nowhere near the level needed to play them without a guide<br> but I get better at it
                            every time I try! much like coding<br>
