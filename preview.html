                <p>The graphics are nothing special nowadays but they still hold up and have moments of
                    charm
                    and character to them, the
                    backgrounds are all pretty interesting and they manage to look better than some of the
                    character
                    models. However
                    the
                    real star of the show here is the catchy soundtrack which still keeps my head banging
                    whilst
                    playing after all
                    of these years, it is so
                    good that I’m going to leave a link to a youtube video of it at the bottom of this
                    review for
                    your listening
                    discretion. The whole package comes
                    together to make a well polished fighter that may be a bit rough around the edges but is
                    worth
                    playing and it
                    will keep you going for a long time
                    if you attempt to do everything in the game, it’s sequel Street Fighter Ex2 seems to be
                    more
                    popular than the
                    first one and is still played competitively today however if you
                    look at this as the framework for the sequel and subsequent Arika fighters it gives you
                    insight
                    into how they
                    work and it's always fun to see
                    the progression of the designers ideas in action. The push for 3D from sony in the early
                    days
                    of the playstation usually led to disaster but in this case it was well handled and
                    created an
                    under appreciated
                    spin off
                    to an already brilliant series.</p>

                <p>I want to go more into the fighting as that is what you will be doing for most of
                    your
                    time
                    in this game, it feels
                    exactly like the Yakuza series but with the added charm of Hokuto No Ken. You can parry, counter or
                    just
                    go all
                    out on
                    attack. The fighting evolves steadily as Kenshiro gains levels and it almost always feels like a
                    meaningful
                    upgrade when
                    you level up. This is done by using a skill tree that let's you choose from different principles of
                    martial
                    arts, this
                    lets the player build up Kenshiro to suit their own fighting style. Once again this is very similar
                    to
                    Yakuza
                    and that
                    isn't a bad thing. One thing that is missing during combat is the use of items in the battlefield,
                    unlike the
                    Yakuza
                    series that would have bikes and street signs laying around for you to pummel your opponents with,
                    this
                    game has
                    a
                    distinct shortage of them and it's not really clear as to why that is the case, I guess one
                    possibility
                    is that
                    live in
                    the nuclear wasteland has ended up with people being less interested in material possessions? who
                    knows!
                    All I
                    know is
                    that you can find a Sega SG-1000 and that's pretty rad.</p>

                    whilst writing the rest of my
                    play through. At the moment progress is pretty slow since I am in the world of ruin and I need to
                    grind
                    a lot to
                    level
                    up my characters before I can take on the tougher side stories and eventually the final boss! So
                    progress is
                    unfortunately slow since grinding can be a painfully slow process but I'm getting there bit by bit
                    and I
                    am
                    still enjoying the ride
                    , considering that I missed this game when I was a kid and I didn't get into Final Fantasy until the
                    release of
                    FF7! it's been interesting
                    to play something that has been in my backlog for way too long now, I attempted to play the
                    Playstation
                    One
                    release of FF6(it came with a demo of FFX!)
                    but for some reason my copy of the game had a weird glitch in it which cut the game dead just after
                    you
                    meet
                    Sabin when you fight Vargis, for some reason
                    the Blitz button combination never worked!! So I couldn't finish the fight.</p>

                <p>I've recently purchased a copy of this fantastic early Fire Emblem title, The
                    vintage
                    does
                    show
                    a bit within the game but
                    it is mostly small things that are missing such as a visual grid on the battlefield instead you have
                    to
                    check
                    your
                    enemies and allies move and attack ranges yourself and plan accordingly. The other changes in this
                    early
                    title
                    are
                    pretty big departures from future games such as Archers being able to attack at point blank range
                    and
                    mages
                    using up
                    their own health points instead of magic points to use attack magic or heal their comrades, There is
                    also no
                    currency
                    system and a few other oddities! Even with all of these changes it still plays well and is a pretty
                    decent
                    strategy game
                    but since I have knowledge of the later games in the series this still feels very much like a
                    prototype
                    instead
                    of a fully
                    formed piece of work, it is still an interesting game to look back on but it is a shame that I can't
                    follow the
                    story at all!
                    I'm pretty sure it'd be interesting and I'd like to see why I'm fighting certain enemies.
                    I'll be writing an article on this fantastic SRPG in the near future.</p>

                    but
                    Iinstead saved hundreds of
                    pounds and bought it from the Japanese PSN store, It's a really fun game that reminds me of the
                    Konami
                    classic
                    Cute-em'up Parodious at times, All of
                    the weapons are dessert and sweet based so you attack with jelly beans, trifles, ice lollies and
                    other
                    assorted
                    treats it's an
                    insane ride through a theme park gone insane but one I always want to stay on just to witness the
                    chaotic
                    spectacle! This game has become
                    a cult classic and for good reason, for some of the most veteran Shmup players it can be a bit too
                    easy
                    but the
                    insanity of it and the detailed
                    backgrounds is what keeps me coming back for more.</p>

                    pretty terrible
                    pseudo- prototype for Castlevania, it's pretty interesting to play, as a huge Castlevania fan it's
                    an
                    exciting
                    premise to be able to play it

                    Shmup's that are A-Jax(Typhoon) - Gradius (Nemesis) - Gradius 2 ( Vulcan Venture) - Salamander (Life
                    Force) -
                    Thunder
                    Cross - Twin Bee and Scramble.
                    so far Thunder Cross and the Gradius titles are my most played games out of the bunch but I'm
                    spending
                    time
                    playing all
                    of them in an attempt to beat them! Since they are arcade ports they have the same level of coin
                    guzzling that
                    you would
                    expect for Shmups of this vintage. I'm going to write a review on this collection when I have spent
                    more
                    time
                    playing
                    it.</p>

                <p>Baroque is a truly unique experience with wonderful world building and a host of
                    strange
                    characters all with their own
                    troubles and histories. I've been playing the Japanese original release of this game and my Japanese
                    is
                    nowhere
                    near
                    good enough for me to play this without the aid of a handy dandy guide, that I will leave a link to
                    if
                    you are
                    interested in this weird but wonderful title. I think this game has built up quite a cult following
                    over
                    the
                    years and
                    hopefully it will become even more popular with the Nintendo Switch receiving a remake of this
                    version
                    of the
                    game.
                    Whether it is released outside of Japan this time round is unknown but the one way to play it
                    without
                    the use of
                    guides
                    to help with the language barrier is to just play the western Wii and Playstation 2 releases, the
                    main
                    change
                    between
                    them is that the remake isn't in first person unlike the Playstation one and Saturn original.</p>
