    <p class="text-break">The graphics are nothing special nowadays but they still hold up and have moments of charm
        and character to them, the
        backgrounds are all pretty interesting and they manage to look better than some of the character models. However
        the
        real star of the show here is the catchy soundtrack which still keeps my head banging whilst playing after all
        of these years, it is so
        good that I’m going to leave a link to a youtube video of it at the bottom of this review for your listening
        discretion. The whole package comes
        together to make a well polished fighter that may be a bit rough around the edges but is worth playing and it
        will keep you going for a long time
        if you attempt to do everything in the game, it’s sequel Street Fighter Ex2 seems to be more popular than the
        first one and is still played competitively today however if you
        look at this as the framework for the sequel and subsequent Arika fighters it gives you insight into how they
        work and it's always fun to see
        the progression of the designers ideas in action. The push for 3D from sony in the early days
        of the playstation usually led to disaster but in this case it was well handled and created an under appreciated
        spin off
        to an already brilliant series.</p>

    <p class="text-break">I want to go more into the fighting as that is what you will be doing for most of your time
        in this game, it feels
        exactly like the Yakuza series but with the added charm of Hokuto No Ken. You can parry, counter or just go all
        out on
        attack. The fighting evolves steadily as Kenshiro gains levels and it almost always feels like a meaningful
        upgrade when
        you level up. This is done by using a skill tree that let's you choose from different principles of martial
        arts, this
        lets the player build up Kenshiro to suit their own fighting style. Once again this is very similar to Yakuza
        and that
        isn't a bad thing. One thing that is missing during combat is the use of items in the battlefield, unlike the
        Yakuza
        series that would have bikes and street signs laying around for you to pummel your opponents with, this game has
        a
        distinct shortage of them and it's not really clear as to why that is the case, I guess one possibility is that
        live in
        the nuclear wasteland has ended up with people being less interested in material possessions? who knows! All I
        know is
        that you can find a Sega SG-1000 and that's pretty rad.</p>

    <img src="../assets/images/ff6 box art.jfif" id="ff6" class="image-thumbnail">
    <p class="text-break">I'm still playing through the amazing Final Fantasy 6 and working my way towards the end
        whilst writing the rest of my
        play through. At the moment progress is pretty slow since I am in the world of ruin and I need to grind a lot to
        level
        up my characters before I can take on the tougher side stories and eventually the final boss! So progress is
        unfortunately slow since grinding can be a painfully slow process but I'm getting there bit by bit and I am still enjoying the ride
        , considering that I missed this game when I was a kid and I didn't get into Final Fantasy until the release of FF7! it's been interesting
        to play something that has been in my backlog for way too long now, I attempted to play the Playstation One release of FF6(it came with a demo of FFX!)
        but for some reason my copy of the game had a weird glitch in it which cut the game dead just after you meet Sabin when you fight Vargis, for some reason
        the Blitz button combination never worked!! So I couldn't finish the fight.</p>

    <h6 class="h6">Fire Emblem Gaiden - Nintendo Famicom</h6>
    <h6 class="h6">Date Reviewed - 06/02/2022</h6><br>
    <img src="../assets/images/ffg box.jfif" id="ffg" class="image-thumbnail">

    <p class="text-break">I've recently purchased a copy of this fantastic early Fire Emblem title, The vintage does
        show
        a bit within the game but
        it is mostly small things that are missing such as a visual grid on the battlefield instead you have to check
        your
        enemies and allies move and attack ranges yourself and plan accordingly. The other changes in this early title
        are
        pretty big departures from future games such as Archers being able to attack at point blank range and mages
        using up
        their own health points instead of magic points to use attack magic or heal their comrades, There is also no
        currency
        system and a few other oddities! Even with all of these changes it still plays well and is a pretty decent strategy game
        but since I have knowledge of the later games in the series this still feels very much like a prototype instead of a fully
        formed piece of work, it is still an interesting game to look back on but it is a shame that I can't follow the story at all! 
        I'm pretty sure it'd be interesting and I'd like to see why I'm fighting certain enemies. 
         I'll be writing an article on this fantastic SRPG in the near future.</p>

    <p class="text-break">Yet Another import Japanese exclusive and one I sadly don't own a physical copy of but I
        instead saved hundreds of
        pounds and bought it from the Japanese PSN store, It's a really fun game that reminds me of the Konami classic
        Cute-em'up Parodious at times, All of
        the weapons are dessert and sweet based so you attack with jelly beans, trifles, ice lollies and other assorted
        treats it's an
        insane ride through a theme park gone insane but one I always want to stay on just to witness the chaotic
        spectacle! This game has become
        a cult classic and for good reason, for some of the most veteran Shmup players it can be a bit too easy but the
        insanity of it and the detailed
        backgrounds is what keeps me coming back for more.</p>

    <img src="../assets/images/konami box.jfif" id="konami" class="image-thumbnail">
    <p class="text-break">This compilation is full of classic Konami arcade Shmup's plus Haunted Castle .... which is a
        pretty terrible
        pseudo- prototype for Castlevania, it's pretty interesting to play, as a huge Castlevania fan it's an exciting
        premise to be able to play it
        but ultimately an infuriating experience, it isn't anywhere near as polished as the console versions of later
        Castlevania games but if you treat it
        as an early idea for the series then it is more compelling when attemping a playthrough. The rest of the
        collection is taken up by a vast array of classic
        Shmup's that are A-Jax(Typhoon) - Gradius (Nemesis) - Gradius 2 ( Vulcan Venture) - Salamander (Life Force) -
        Thunder
        Cross - Twin Bee and Scramble.
        so far Thunder Cross and the Gradius titles are my most played games out of the bunch but I'm spending time
        playing all
        of them in an attempt to beat them! Since they are arcade ports they have the same level of coin guzzling that
        you would
        expect for Shmups of this vintage. I'm going to write a review on this collection when I have spent more time
        playing
        it.</p>

    <img src="../assets/images/baroque box.jfif" id="baroque" class="image-thumbnail">
    <p class="text-break">Baroque is a truly unique experience with wonderful world building and a host of strange
        characters all with their own
        troubles and histories. I've been playing the Japanese original release of this game and my Japanese is nowhere
        near
        good enough for me to play this without the aid of a handy dandy guide, that I will leave a link to if you are
        interested in this weird but wonderful title. I think this game has built up quite a cult following over the
        years and
        hopefully it will become even more popular with the Nintendo Switch receiving a remake of this version of the
        game.
        Whether it is released outside of Japan this time round is unknown but the one way to play it without the use of
        guides
        to help with the language barrier is to just play the western Wii and Playstation 2 releases, the main change
        between
        them is that the remake isn't in first person unlike the Playstation one and Saturn original.</p>
